# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Introduction

JisokuDict ("the App") is a Japanese-English dictionary application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data (Stored on Your Device)

The App stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Search History** - Your recent dictionary searches to provide quick access to previous lookups
- **Favorites** - Words and kanji you mark as favorites for easy reference

This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third party.

### iCloud Sync

If you are signed into iCloud, your favorites and search history may be synced across your devices using Apple's iCloud service. This data is protected by Apple's privacy policies and is not accessible to us.

### Advertising Data

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect:

- Device identifiers (such as advertising ID)
- General location data (country/region level)
- App usage and interaction data
- Ad viewing and interaction data

This data is collected by Google and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.

## How We Use Your Information

**Local Data:** Your search history and favorites are used solely to improve your experience within the App by providing quick access to your recent and saved items.

**Advertising Data:** Data collected by AdMob is used to serve relevant advertisements and to measure ad performance.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties.

The only third-party service that receives data is Google AdMob for advertising purposes. No other data leaves your device.

## Data Retention

**Local Data:** Search history and favorites remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App. You can clear this data at any time through the App settings.

**Advertising Data:** Data collected by AdMob is retained according to Google's data retention policies.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access** your data stored in the App (visible in search history and favorites)

- **Opt out** of personalized advertising through your device settings

To limit ad tracking on iOS, go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking**.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Third-Party Links

The App may contain links to external websites (such as the EDRDG dictionary project). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.
